# Multithreading & Thread Synchronization Project

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I dive deep into the world of multithreading and thread synchronization, reinforcing my knowledge through practical programming exercises. This project serves as a personal exploration and implementation of various concepts and techniques learned from the Udemy course titled "Part A - Multithreading & Thread Synchronization - Pthreads".



## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to reinforce my understanding of multithreading concepts by programming some key topics such as synchronization techniques. Through hands-on coding exercises, I aim to grasp the intricacies of thread synchronization, understand the challenges of managing shared resources in a multithreaded environment, and explore the solutions provided by different synchronization mechanisms.
